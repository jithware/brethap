# Audio Files
Audio files for inclusion into Brethap must be [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management)-free and in the [OGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg) file format.

### Silence
The [silence15.oga](./silence15.oga) is a 15 second silent audio file generated using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/). To create silence, follow this [guide](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/silence.html). A silence audio tone is included to allow brethap to continue running with the display off. For more information on why this was done, see [#100](https://github.com/jithware/brethap/issues/100).
